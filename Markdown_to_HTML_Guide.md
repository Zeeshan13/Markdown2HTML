The directory structire should be as below:

![image](https://github.com/Zeeshan13/Markdown2HTML/blob/main/Images/Image_4.png)

### Setting Up the Script

Save the following Python script as `m2hgit.py`. It processes all `.md` files in the current directory and subdirectories, converts them to HTML, and applies a consistent CSS style.

#### The Python Script: Detailed Breakdown

**1. Importing Required Libraries**

```python
import os
import re
import markdown
from markdown.extensions.codehilite import CodeHiliteExtension
from markdown.extensions.toc import TocExtension
```

- `os`: To traverse files in directories.
- `re`: For regular expression matching (e.g., handling image links).
- `markdown`: Converts Markdown to HTML.
- Extensions: Add features like syntax highlighting and a table of contents.

---

**2. Configuring GitHub Details**

```python
GITHUB_USER = "Zeeshan13"
GITHUB_REPO = "Markdown2HTML"
GITHUB_BRANCH = "main"
```

These details are used to construct image URLs for Markdown files hosted in a GitHub repository.

---

**3. Defining CSS for Styling**

 - **Purpose**: Ensures that the generated HTML files are visually appealing and easy to read by applying consistent styling.
   - **Implementation**:  
     A CSS block is defined as a string (`css_content`) in the script. It specifies styles for fonts, colors, headings, code blocks, links, and images.  
     Example:  

     ```python
     css_content = """
     body {
         font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
         line-height: 1.6;
         color: #333;
         margin: 20px;
     }
     """
     ```
   - **Functionality**: The CSS is saved to a file (`styles.css`) and linked to the HTML documents, ensuring uniform styling across all converted files.
   - This block defines styles for the HTML output, such as fonts, colors, and layout for headings, images, and code blocks.

---

**4. Handling GitHub Image Links**

- **Purpose**: Resolves broken or relative image links in Markdown files, especially those pointing to GitHub repositories, by transforming them into valid raw URLs.
   - **Implementation**:  
     - The function `fix_github_image_links` uses regular expressions to identify Markdown image links (e.g., `![Alt Text](image_path)`).
     - It replaces relative paths or GitHub `blob` links with `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs, ensuring images load correctly.  
     Example Transformation:  

     - Input:  
       ```markdown
       ![Example](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/image.png)
       ```
     - Output:  
       ```markdown
       ![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/image.png)
       ```
   - **Functionality**: The processed Markdown content is passed to the HTML generator, ensuring accurate image rendering.



**5. Removing Pilcrow Symbols**

```python
def remove_pilcrow_from_html(html_content):
    # Removes pilcrow (¶) symbols added by some Markdown extensions.
```

Optional but useful for a cleaner HTML output.

---

**6. Converting Markdown to HTML**

 - **Purpose**: Converts the content of Markdown files into HTML using the `markdown` library.
   - **Implementation**:  
     - The `convert_md_to_html` function applies extensions like `fenced_code` and `TocExtension` for better formatting and navigation.
     - It wraps the converted HTML content in a complete HTML structure, including a `<head>` with CSS linkage and a `<body>` containing the content.  
     Example:  

     ```python
     html_with_css = f"""<!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="{css_filename}">
     </head>
     <body>
     {html_content}
     </body>
     </html>
     """
     ```

This function:
1. Fixes image links.
2. Converts Markdown to HTML using `markdown.markdown`.
3. Wraps the HTML in a full `<html>` document with the provided CSS.

---

**7. Processing Markdown Files**

```python
def process_markdown_files():
    # Traverses directories, reads .md files, converts them, and saves as .html.
```

The script:
- Generates the CSS file.
- Converts each Markdown file in the directory tree into an HTML file.
- Handles errors gracefully.


**8. Recursive File Processing**
   - **Purpose**: Enables the script to process all Markdown files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
   - **Implementation**:  
     - The `os.walk` function traverses through the directory structure, identifying all `.md` files.
     - For each Markdown file:
       1. The script reads its content.
       2. Converts it into HTML.
       3. Saves the output HTML file in the same location as the original Markdown file.  
     Example:  

     ```python
     for root, _, files in os.walk("."):
         for filename in files:
             if filename.endswith(".md"):
                 md_filepath = os.path.join(root, filename)
                 ...
     ```
   - **Functionality**: Automates the conversion process for large projects containing multiple Markdown files.
